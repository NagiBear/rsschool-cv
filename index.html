                for the Ministry of defense, government organizations, and various companies, and I am working on my
                own projects. I attend various courses and webinars to improve my skills in this field.</p>
            <p>March 2020 – now: I am working on an app interface for online rap battles. It will made in the
                style of a comic book and represent a kind of online platform for communication and battles between
                other users.
                February 2020 - now: I developed a prototype app for the Russian Orthodox Church. I am at
                the stage of searching for an investor to release this application.
                February 2020: During the Projector2020 hackathon, I made user experience and user interface
                apps for migrants. This concept received the third place and found investors for further
                implementation.
                November 2019 – December 2020: I worked on a prototype of the app, which is a social network
                for motorists. The app has a huge functionality that I was able to show in my prototype.
                November 2020: During the Baltic Sea Hackathon, I came up with the functionality and interface
                of the application for monitoring and collecting statistics for the administration of St. Petersburg. This
                functionality and the presented technologies are taken as the basis for the application being developed.
                September 2020 – October 2020: I came up with and developed a prototype of a messenger for
                the Armed forces, which was approved and will soon be implemented in this structure.
                Here are the major projects over the past six months, in addition, I took orders for landing,
                creation of logos, icons, etc.</p>
